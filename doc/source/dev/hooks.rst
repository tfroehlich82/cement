Framework and Application Hooks
===============================

Hooks allow the developers to tie into different pieces of the application.
A hook can be defined anywhere, be it internally in the application, or in a
plugin.  Once a hook is defined, functions can be registered to that hook so
that when the hook is called, all functions registered to that hook will be
run.  By defining a hook, you are saying that you are going to honor that hook
somewhere in your application.  Using descriptive hook names are good for
clarity.  For example, ``pre_database_connect`` is obviously a hook that
will be run before a database connection is attempted.

The most important thing to remember when defining hooks for your application
is to properly document them.  Include whether anything is expected in return
or what, if any, arguments will be passed to the hook functions when called.

Defining a Hook
---------------

A hook can be defined anywhere, however it is generally recommended to define
the hook as early as possible.  A hook definition simply gives a label to the
hook, and allows the developer (or third-party plugin developers) to register 
functions to that hook.  It's label is arbitrary.

The most convenient way to define a hook is via 
``CementApp.Meta.define_hooks``:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp

    class MyApp(CementApp):
        class Meta:
            label = 'myapp'
            define_hooks = ['my_example_hook']


Alternatively, if you need more control you might do it in 
``CementApp.setup()``:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp

    class MyApp(CementApp):
        class Meta:
            label = 'myapp'

        def setup(self):
            # always run core setup first
            super(MyApp, self).setup()

            # define application hooks here
            self.hook.define('my_example_hook')


Registering Functions to a Hook
-------------------------------

A hook is just an identifier, but the functions registered to that hook are
what get run when the hook is called.  Registering a hook function should also
be done early on in the bootstrap process, any time after the application has
been created, after the hook is defined, and before the hook is run.  Note
that every hook is different, and therefore should be clearly documented by
the 'owner' of the hook (application developer, plugin developer, etc).

The most convenient way to register a hook function is with 
``CementApp.Meta.hooks``:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp

    def my_hook1(app):
        pass

    def my_hook2(app):
        pass

    class MyApp(CementApp):
        class Meta:
            hooks = [
                ('post_argument_parsing', my_hook1),
                ('pre_close', my_hook2),
                ]

    with MyApp() as app:
        app.run()


Where ``CementApp.Meta.hooks`` is a list of tuples that define the hook label,
and the function to register to that hook.

Alternatively, if you need more control you might use:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp

    def my_hook1(app):
        pass

    with CementApp('myapp') as app:
        app.hook.register('post_argument_parsing', my_hook1)
        app.run()


Or, for a third-party plugin:

.. code-block:: python

    def my_hook1(app):
        pass

    def load(app):
        app.hook.register('post_argument_parsing', my_hook1)


What you return depends on what the developer defining the hook is expecting.
Each hook is different, and the nature of the hook determines whether you need
to return anything or not.  That is up to the developer.  Also, the ``args``
and ``kwargs`` coming in depend on the developer.  You have to be familiar
with the purpose of the defined hook in order to know whether you are
receiving any ``args`` or ``kwargs``.


Running a hook
--------------

Now that a hook is defined, and functions have been registered to that hook
all that is left is to run it.  Keep in mind, you don't want to run a hook
until after the application load process... meaning, after all plugins and
other code are loaded.  If you receive an error that the hook doesn't exist,
then you are trying to register a hook too soon before the hook is defined.
Likewise, if it doesn't seem like your hook is running and you don't see it
mentioned in ``--debug`` output, you might be registering your hook **after**
the hook has already run.

That said, this is how you run a hook:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp

    with CementApp('myapp') as app:
        for res in app.hook.run('my_example_hook'):
            # do something with res?
            pass


As you can see we iterate over the hook, rather than just calling
``app.hook.run()`` by itself.  This is necessary because ``app.hook.run()`` 
yields the results from each hook function as they are run.  Hooks can be run 
anywhere **after** the hook is defined, and hooks are registered to that hook.


Controlling Hook Run Order
--------------------------

Sometimes you might have a very specific purpose in mind for a hook, and need
it to run before or after other functions in the same hook.  For that reason
there is an optional ``weight`` parameter that can be passed when registering
a hook function.

The following is an example application that defines, registers, and runs
a custom application hook:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp

    class MyApp(CementApp):
        class Meta:
            label = 'myapp'

        def setup(self):
            # always run core setup
            super(MyApp, self).setup()

            # define hooks in setup
            self.hook.define('my_hook')


    # the following are the function that will run when ``my_hook`` is called
    def func1(app):
        print 'Inside hook func1'

    def func2(app):
        print 'Inside hook func2'

    def func3(app):
        print 'Inside hook func3'


    with MyApp() as app:
        # register all hook functions *after* the hook is defined (setup) but
        # also *before* the hook is called (different for every hook)
        app.hook.register('my_hook', func1, weight=0)
        app.hook.register('my_hook', func2, weight=100)
        app.hook.register('my_hook', func3, weight=-99)

        # run the application
        app.run()

        # run our custom hook
        for res in self.hook.run('my_hook', app):
            pass


And the result is:

.. code-block:: text

    $ python my_hook_test.py
    Inside hook func3
    Inside hook func1
    Inside hook func2


As you can see, it doesnâ€™t matter what order we register the hook, the
weight runs then in order from lowest to highest.

Cement Framework Hooks
----------------------

Cement has a number of hooks that tie into the framework.

pre_setup
^^^^^^^^^

Run first when ``CementApp.setup()`` is called.  The application object is
passed as an argument.  Nothing is expected in return.


post_setup
^^^^^^^^^^

Run last when CementApp.setup() is called.  The application object is
passed as an argument.  Nothing is expected in return.


pre_run
^^^^^^^

Run first when CementApp.run() is called.  The application object is
passed as an argument.  Nothing is expected in return.


post_run
^^^^^^^^

Run last when CementApp.run() is called.  The application object is
passed as an argument.  Nothing is expected in return.


pre_argument_parsing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run after CementApp.run() is called, just *before* argument parsing happens.
The application object is passed as an argument to these hook
functions.  Nothing is expected in return.


post_argument_parsing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run after CementApp.run() is called, just *after* argument parsing happens.
The application object is passed as an argument to these hook
functions.  Nothing is expected in return.

This hook is generally useful where the developer needs to perform actions
based on the arguments that were passed at command line, but before the
logic of `app.run()` happens.


pre_render
^^^^^^^^^^

Run first when CementApp.render() is called.  The application object, and
data dictionary are passed as arguments.  Must return either the original
data dictionary, or a modified one.

Note: This does not affect anything that is 'printed' to console.


post_render
^^^^^^^^^^^

Run last when CementApp.render() is called.  The application object, and
rendered output text are passed as arguments.  Must return either the original
output text, or a modified version.


pre_close
^^^^^^^^^

Run first when app.close() is called.  This hook should be used by plugins and
extensions to do any 'cleanup' at the end of program execution.  Nothing is
expected in return.


post_close
^^^^^^^^^^

Run last when app.close() is called.  Most use cases need pre_close(),
however this hook is available should one need to do anything after all other
'close' operations.


signal
^^^^^^

Run when signal handling is enabled, and the defined signal handler callback
is executed.  This hook should be used by the application, plugins, and
extensions to perform any actions when a specific signal is caught.  Nothing
is expected in return.
