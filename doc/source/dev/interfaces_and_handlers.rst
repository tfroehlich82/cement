Interfaces and Handlers
=======================

Cement has a unique interface and handler system that is used to break up
pieces of the framework and allow customization of how Cement handles
everything from logging to config file parsing, and almost every action in
between.

The Cement Interface code is loosely modeled after `Zope Interface <http://old.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface>`_
which allows a developer to define an interface that other developers can then
create implementations for.  For example, an interface might define that a
class have a function called ``_setup()``.  Any implementation of that
interface must provide a function called ``_setup()``, and perform the
expected actions when called.

In Cement, we call the implementation of interfaces ``handlers`` and provide
the ability to easily register, and retrieve them via the app.

Defining an Interface
---------------------

Cement uses interfaces and handlers extensively to manage the framework,
however developers can also make use of this system to provide a clean, and
standardized way of allowing other developers to customize their application.

The following defines a basic interface:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp
    from cement.core.interface import Interface, Attribute

    class MyInterface(Interface):
        class IMeta:
            label = 'myinterface'

        # Must be provided by the implementation
        Meta = Attribute('Handler Meta-data')
        my_var = Attribute('A variable of epic proportions.')

        def _setup(app_obj):
            """
            The setup function is called during application initialization and
            must 'setup' the handler object making it ready for the framework
            or the application to make further calls to it.

            Required Arguments:

                app_obj
                    The application object.

            Returns: n/a

            """

        def do_something():
            """
            This function does something.

            """

    class MyApp(CementApp):
        class Meta:
            label = 'myapp'
            define_handlers = [MyInterface]


Alternatively, if you need more control you might define a handler this 
way:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp
    
    with CementApp('myapp') as app:
        # define interfaces after app is created
        app.handler.define(MyInterface)

        app.run()


The above simply defines the interface.  It does *not* implement any
functionality, and can't be used directly.  This is why the class
functions do not have an argument of ``self``, nor do they contain any code
other than comments.

That said, what is required is an ``IMeta`` class that is used to interact
with the interface.  At the very least, this must include a unique ``label``
to identify the interface.  This can also be considered the 'handler type'.
For example, the ``ILog`` interface has a label of ``log`` and any handlers
registered to that interface are stored in 
``HandlerManager.__handlers__['log']``.

Notice that we defined ``Meta`` and ``my_var`` as Interface Attributes.  This
is a simple identifier that describes an attribute that an implementation is
expected to provide.

Validating Interfaces
---------------------

A validator call back function can be defined in the interfaces IMeta class
like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core import interface

    def my_validator(klass, obj):
        members = [
            '_setup',
            'do_something',
            'my_var',
            ]
        interface.validate(MyInterface, obj, members)

    class MyInterface(interface.Interface):
        class IMeta:
            label = 'myinterface'
            validator = my_validator
        ...

When ``CementApp.handler.register()`` is called to register a handler to an 
interface, the validator is called and the handler object is passed to the 
validator.  In the above example, we simply define what members we want to 
validate for and then call ``interface.validate()`` which will raise
``cement.core.exc.InterfaceError`` if validation fails.  It is not
necessary to use ``interface.validate()`` but it is useful and recommended.
In general, the key thing to note is that a validator either raises
``InterfaceError`` or does nothing if validation passes.


Registering Handlers to an Interface
------------------------------------

An interface simply defines what an implementation is expected to provide,
where a handler actually implements the interface.  The following example
is a handler that implements the MyInterface above:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp
    from cement.core.handler import CementBaseHandler
    from myapp.interfaces import MyInterface

    class MyHandler(CementBaseHandler):
        class Meta:
            interface = MyInterface
            label = 'my_handler'
            description = 'This handler implements MyInterface'
            config_defaults = dict(
                foo='bar'
                )

        my_var = 'This is my var'

        def __init__(self):
            self.app = None

        def _setup(self, app_obj):
            self.app = app_obj

        def do_something(self):
            print "Doing work!"

    class MyApp(CementApp):
        class Meta:
            label = 'myapp'
            handlers = [MyHandler]

Alternatively, if you need more control you might use this approach:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp

    with CementApp('myapp') as app:
        # register handler after the app is created
        app.handler.register(MyHandler)

        app.run()


The above is a simple class that meets all the expectations of the interface.
When calling ``CementApp.handler.register()``, ``MyHandler`` is passed to the 
validator (if defined in the interface) and if it passes validation will be 
registered into ``HandlerManager.__handlers__``.


Using Handlers
--------------

The following are a few examples of working with handlers:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp

    with CementApp('myapp') as app:
        # Get a log handler called 'logging'
        lh = app.handler.get('log', 'logging')

        # Instantiate the handler class, passing any keyword arguments that 
        # the handler supports.
        log = log_handler()

        # Setup the handler, passing it the app object.
        log._setup(app)

        # List all handlers of type 'config'
        app.handler.list('config')

        # Check if an interface called 'output' is defined
        app.handler.defined('output')

        # Check if the handler 'argparse' is registered to the 'argument' 
        # interface
        app.handler.registered('argument', 'argparse')


It is important to note that handlers are stored with the app as 
uninstantiated objects.  Meaning you must instantiate them after retrieval,
and call ``_setup(app)`` when using handlers directly (as in the above
example).


Overriding Default Handlers
---------------------------

Cement sets up a number of default handlers for logging, config parsing, etc.
These can be overridden in a number of ways.  The first way is by passing
them as keyword arguments to ``CementApp``:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp
    from myapp.log import MyLogHandler

    # Create the application
    app = CementApp('myapp', log_handler=MyLogHandler)
    app.setup()
    app.run()
    app.close()

The second way to override a handler is by setting it directly in the
``CementApp`` meta data:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp
    from myapp.log import MyLogHandler

    class MyApp(CementApp):
        class Meta:
            label = 'myapp'
            log_handler = MyLogHandler

    with MyApp() as app:
        app.run()


There are times that you may want to pre-instantiate handlers before
passing them to CementApp().  The following works just the same:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp
    from myapp.log import MyLogHandler

    my_log = MyLogHandler(some_param='some_value')

    class MyApp(CementApp):
        class Meta:
            label = 'myapp'
            log_handler = my_log

    with MyApp() as app:
        app.run()


To see what default handlers can be overridden, see the
:ref:`cement.core.foundation <cement.core.foundation>` documentation.


Multiple Registered Handlers
----------------------------

All handlers and interfaces are unique.  In most cases, where the framework
is concerned, only one handler is used.  For example, whatever is configured
for the ``log_handler`` will be used and setup as ``app.log``.  However, take
for example an Output Handler.  You might have a default ``output_handler`` of
``mustache``' (a text templating language) but may also want to override that
handler with the ``json`` output handler when ``-o json`` is passed at command
line.  In order to allow this functionality, both the ``mustache`` and
``json`` output handlers must be registered.

Any number of handlers can be registered to an interface.  You might have a
use case for an Interface/Handler that may provide different compatibility
base on the operating system, or perhaps based on simply how the application
is called.  A good example would be an application that automates building
packages for Linux distributions.  An interface would define what a build
handler needs to provide, but the build handler would be different based on
the OS.  The application might have an ``rpm`` build handler, or a ``dpkg``
build handler to perform the build process differently.


Customizing Handlers
--------------------

The most common way to customize a handler is to subclass it, and then pass
it to ``CementApp``:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp
    from cement.lib.ext_logging import LoggingLogHandler

    class MyLogHandler(LoggingLogHandler):
        class Meta:
            label = 'mylog'

        def info(self, msg):
            # do something to customize this function, here...
            super(MyLogHandler, self).info(msg)

    app = CementApp('myapp', log_handler=MyLogHandler)


Hander Default Configuration Settings
-------------------------------------

All handlers can define default config file settings via their
``config_defaults`` meta option.  These will be merged into the ``app.config``
under the ``[handler_interface].[handler_label]`` section.  These settings are
overridden in the following order.

 * The config_defaults dictionary passed to ``CementApp``
 * Via any application config files with a
   ``[handler_interface].[handler_type]`` block (i.e. ``cache.memcached``)


The following shows how to override defaults by passing them with the defaults
dictionary to ``CementApp``:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core import foundation
    from cement.utils.misc import init_defaults

    defaults = init_defaults('myinterface.myhandler')
    defaults['myinterface.myhandler'] = dict(foo='bar')
    app = foundation.CementApp('myapp', config_defaults=defaults)


Cement will use all defaults set via ``MyHandler.Meta.config_defaults`` (for
this example), and then override just what is passed via
``config_defaults['myinterface.myhandler']``.  You should use this approach
only to modify the global defaults for your application.  The second way is to
then set configuration file defaults under the ``[myinterface.myhandler]``
section.  For example:

**my.config**

.. code-block:: text

    [myinterface.myhandler]
    foo = bar


In the real world this may look like ``[cache.memcached]``, or
``[database.mysql]`` depending on what the interface label, and handler
label's are.  Additionally, individual handlers can override their config
section by setting ``Meta.config_section``.


Overriding Handlers Via Command Line
------------------------------------

In some use cases, you will want the end user to have access to override the
default handler of a particular interface.  For example, Cement ships with
multiple Output Handlers including ``json``, ``yaml``, and ``mustache``.  A
typical application might default to using ``mustache`` to render console
output from text templates.  That said, without changing any code in the
application, the end user can simply pass the ``-o json`` command line
option and output the same data that is rendered to template, out in pure
JSON.

The only built-in handler override that Cement includes is for the above
mentioned example, but you can add any that your application requires.

The following example shows this in action... note that the following is
already setup by Cement, but we're putting it here for clarity:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core.foundation import CementApp

    class MyApp(CementApp):
        class Meta:
            label = 'myapp'

            # define what extensions we want to load
            extensions = ['mustache', 'json', 'yaml']

            # define our default output handler
            output_handler = 'mustache'

            # define our handler override options
            handler_override_options = dict(
                output = (['-o'], dict(help='output format')),
                )


    with MyApp() as app:
        # run the application
        app.run()

        # define some data for the output handler
        data = dict(foo='bar')

        # render something using out output handlers, using mustache by
        # default which will use the default.m templae
        app.render(data, 'default.m')



Note what we see at command line:

.. code-block:: text

    $ python myapp.py --help
    usage: myapp.py [-h] [--debug] [--quiet] [-o {yaml,json}]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help      show this help message and exit
      --debug         toggle debug output
      --quiet         suppress all output
      -o {yaml,json}  output format


Notice the ``-o`` command line option, that includes the choices: ``yaml``
and ``json``.  This feature will include all Output Handlers that have the
``overridable`` meta-data option set to ``True``.  The MustacheOutputHandler
does not set this option, therefore it does not show up as a valid choice.

Now what happens when we run it?

.. code-block:: text

    $ python myapp.py

    This text is being rendered via Mustache.
    The value of the 'foo' variable is => 'bar'

The above is the default output, using ``mustache`` as our ``output_handler``,
and rendering the output text from a template called ``default.m``.  We can
now override the output handler using the ``-o`` option and modify the output
format:

.. code-block:: text

    $ python myapp.py -o json
    {"foo": "bar"}


Again, any handler can be overridden in this fashion.
